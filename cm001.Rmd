# Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we anticipate students will:

- Be oriented with the course structure and resources.
- Be exposed to the main themes of the course, and understand their value.
- Have created a GitHub account, and have installed RStudio.
- Understand what a plain text file is, their value, and alternatives (that are less desireable for data analytic work).
- Know how to make plain text files with RStudio.

# Orientation to STAT 545

- Course history
